## Installation
- Clone this repository and navigate into its root directory on a terminal or command line interface.
### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### Explanation:

 - The `public` directory contains the website logo and vite.svg.
 - The `src` directory is the main directory for the project's source code.
 - The `assets` directory holds static assets such as website logo and react svg.
 - The `components` directory contains reusable UI components organized into separate folders (e.g., Header, Footer). Each component has its own directory with a `.jsx` file for the component's logic and a corresponding CSS file for styling.
 - The `container` directory includes container components that manage the presentation and state logic for specific sections or features of your application.
 - The `pages` directory contains components that represent different pages of the website. Each page has its own directory(e.g., appointments_pages, signup_pages) with a .js file for the page's logic and a corresponding CSS file for styling.
 - The `services` directory houses modules responsible for making API requests or handling data-related tasks.
 - The `models` directory contains utility/helper functions or modules used throughout the project.
 - The `App.js`  file is the main entry point for the React application, where you define the overall structure and routing.
 - The `index.js` file is the entry point for the ReactDOM rendering, where the React application is rendered into the HTML document.
 - The root directory contains configuration files such as `.gitignore`, `package-lock.json`, `package.json`, and `README.md.`
 - The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by version control.
 - The `package.json` file includes project metadata and lists dependencies and scripts.
 - The `README.md` file provides an overview and documentation for the project.
 - This folder structure provides a modular and organized approach to managing your React website project, separating components, pages, assets, and other resources into their respective directories. Feel free to adjust and customize it based on your specific project requirements and preferences.
